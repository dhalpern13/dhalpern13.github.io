I am currently a fourth year computer science student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca). I enjoy doing research mainly in theoretical computer science. So far, most of my research experience has been in algorithmic game theory, specifically in fair division and social choice. Since May of 2018, I have worked with [Nisarg Shah](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/) at the University of Toronto. Since the beginning of the summer of 2019, I have also worked with [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info) at Carnegie Mellon University.
