I am a Research Scientist at Google Research. I completed a PhD in computer science at Harvard University, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info). Before Harvard, I received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Toronto, where I had the great pleasure of working with [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html).

My research broadly sits at the intersection of algorithms, economics, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I consider novel settings where groups of people need to make collective decisions, such as summarizing population views on large-scale opinion aggregation websites, using participant data to fine-tune large language models, and selecting panel members for citizensâ€™ assemblies. In each case, I develop provably fair solutions to aggregate individual preferences.
