I am a recently-graduated student from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) where I majored in computer science. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer science and economics, specifically in algorithmic game thoery and computational social choice. At the University of Toronto, I was incredibly fortunate to have worked under the supervision of [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html). In the fall, I will begin working on a PhD at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu) and I am excited to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info).
