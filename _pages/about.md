I am a PhD candidate in the [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info) and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics, particularly in fair division and computational social choice. Before joining Harvard, I completed an undergraduate degree in computer science at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), where I had the great pleasure of working with [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html).
