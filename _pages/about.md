I am a first-year PhD student in the [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info). My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical computer science and economics, paticularly in fair division and computational social choice. Prior to joining Harvard, I completed an undergraduate degree in computer science at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) where I had the great pleasure of working under the supervision of [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html).
