I am a PhD candidate in the [EconCS group](https://econcs.seas.harvard.edu) at [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Ariel Procaccia](http://procaccia.info). I am supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) and a [Siebel Scholarship](https://www.siebelscholars.com).

My research broadly sits at the intersection of algorithms, economics, and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I consider novel settings where groups of people need to make collective decisions, such as summarizing population views on large-scale opinion aggregation websites, using participant data to fine-tune large language models, and selecting panel members for citizensâ€™ assemblies. In each case, I develop provably fair solutions to aggregate individual preferences.

Before joining Harvard, I received a Bachelor of Science from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), where I had the great pleasure of working with [Nisarg Shah](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nisarg/index.html).
